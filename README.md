# Scalable Edge: Face Detection using AWS IoT Greengrass

## üìò Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning‚Äìbased face detection pipeline using AWS edge computing services. By leveraging AWS IoT Greengrass and associated services, we design a distributed architecture that performs real-time face detection on image data received from IoT devices. The goal is to offload computational tasks from centralized cloud infrastructure and enable intelligent processing directly at the edge‚Äîthereby reducing latency, preserving bandwidth, and enhancing privacy.

The project uses EC2 instances to emulate both IoT devices and edge nodes, integrating them through secure MQTT-based messaging. It showcases how AWS-native services can be orchestrated to build a production-grade edge-cloud pipeline for computer vision tasks.

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement an edge computing pipeline for face detection using AWS services  
- Deploy and run machine learning models at the edge using AWS IoT Greengrass  
- Simulate IoT device communication using MQTT over AWS IoT Core  
- Enable real-time message routing from edge to cloud using AWS SQS  
- Achieve modularity and scalability in the ML inference workflow by separating detection and recognition stages  

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **IoT Device Simulation**  
   An EC2 instance simulates an IoT device that encodes image frames as Base64 strings and publishes them to an MQTT topic via AWS IoT Core.

2. **Greengrass Core Deployment**  
   Another EC2 instance runs AWS IoT Greengrass Core. It hosts a custom Greengrass component that:
   - Subscribes to the MQTT topic
   - Decodes incoming image data
   - Uses a pretrained MTCNN model for face detection
   - Sends the detected face(s) to an AWS SQS queue for further processing

3. **Cloud Integration via SQS**  
   Detected face data is forwarded to AWS SQS, forming a bridge to any cloud-based consumer services such as AWS Lambda for face recognition or post-processing.

4. **Security & Provisioning**  
   All communication is secured using X.509 certificates managed through AWS IoT, and IAM roles are used to securely enable token-based access to SQS.
